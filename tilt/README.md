## What is this?

> Local Kubernetes development with no stress.
> Tilt helps you develop your microservices locally without slowing you down or making you play Twenty Questions with kubectl.
> Tilt replaces docker build && kubectl apply or docker-compose. It watches your files, updates automatically, and gives you a UI that shows you error so you don't have to spelunk with kubectl.
