# Run a local kubernetes cluster on your MacBook

This is a quickstart guide to using kubernetes locally on your Mac.  Following  this guide will yield a lightweight (fast) kuberenetes cluster for local development, fun and profit.  

> I highly recommend it as an alternative to minikube.

## Why not minikube

I find minikube to be a bit overkill on a laptop, and don't really like the user experience.  It exposes to me (as a developer) a different interface/workflow/command line than a production cluster. Why use/learn/entertain a divergent set of commands?  I also find this to be much faster and architecturally more sound and futureproof.  The full rationale is beyond the scope of this quickstart. If interested to learn more and/or dig deeper the following is a good breadcrumb trail.

### The now (and future): K8s and containerd, CRI

## Enable Kubernetes Support

This guide assumes you're already running Docker CE for Mac.

Enable Kubernetes support.  I prefer to allow the containers being leveraged to appear via normal docker commands.

Depending on your use cases you might want to bump memory/disk, or setup additional storage.

## Set your context

```bash
kubectl config use-context docker-for-desktop
```

## deploy the kubernetes dashboard

The official [dashboard wiki] is the source of truth.  There's a nice issue / thread ([kubernetes/dashboard: 2474](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard/issues/2474)for some background if you're really curious about why your normal kubeconfig file will likely not work.  TLDR: you need a token, not a cert.

Deploy directly from github HEAD...

```bash
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/master/src/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml
```

or

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kubernetes/dashboard.git && cd dashboard
kubectl create -f src/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml
```

Example:

```shell
(âŽˆ |docker-for-desktop:default)halcyondude@chezmoi:~/k8s$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes/dashboard/master/src/deploy/recommended/kubernetes-dashboard.yaml
secret/kubernetes-dashboard-certs created
serviceaccount/kubernetes-dashboard created
role.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kubernetes-dashboard-minimal created
rolebinding.rbac.authorization.k8s.io/kubernetes-dashboard-minimal created
deployment.apps/kubernetes-dashboard created
service/kubernetes-dashboard created
```

## access dashboard

There are a number of options and approaches regarding security that are out of scope for this quickstart.
