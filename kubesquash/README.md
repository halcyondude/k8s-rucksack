_(from project readme)_

>KubeSquash is a tool for live debugging of microservices running on Kubernetes. By attaching modern debuggers to your microservices application, KubeSquash gives you the full strength of live debugging : getting/setting the value of variables, adding pauses and sleeps in certain portions of the code, forcing the execution of specific code paths, etc.
